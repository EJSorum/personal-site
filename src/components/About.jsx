            My life has been defined by self-starting and curiosity, and its no wonder the past year
            of teaching myself software development has been perhaps the most fulfilling period in
            my life.

            I have been crazy about computers ever since I first got to play around with the DOS
            prompt on my dad&aposs ancient 486. I went to computer camp in 7th and 8th grade to
            learn C++ and knew that one day I would be a computer programmer.
          </p>
          <p>
            The past 15 years has seen me in numerous leadership positions requiring excellent
            communication and creativity. I thrive when given open-ended goals and a little bit of
            elbow-room
          </p>

            My history of self-motivated success will be invaluable to your company. I would be a
            perfect fit for any web development position, with the proven ability to quickly adapt
            and learn any language or technology.
